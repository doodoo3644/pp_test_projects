For Prapas:

Is it possible to use Bootstrap without it taking over the entire style?



------------
You can also download bootstrap from here: Bootstrap source (http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master) and then enter the "less" directory and add a file called "bootstrap-custom.less" where you'll enter the following content:


.bs-cnt {
    @import "bootstrap.less";
}


"bs-cnt" for BootStrap-CoNTainer. You can make it longer if you want, but remember that it'll be pasted in a lot of places in the compiled CSS, so it's to save space in the end file.

After you've done this, simple compile the bootstrap-custom.less file with your favourite less compiler (SimpLESS is pretty good if you're on Windows), and then you'll have a compiled bootstrap file that only works when you place a container element with the class of "bs-cnt".


<div class="bs-cnt">
    <button class="btn btn-success btn-large">This button will be affected by bootstrap</button>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-danger">This however; Won't</button>
